## ‚úâÔ∏è Quote Email Prompt

**Purpose:** Generate a polite email requesting a service quote.

**Prompt Template:**

## Vendor Json Generator
**Purpose**

**Prompt Template:**
I‚Äôm in {CITY}.

    Find custom glass tabletop fabricators (minimum 5, maximum 8) that serve this city.

    For each company return a single JSON object with exactly these keys (all strings except services, which is an array of short strings):

{
  "name": "",
  "phone": "",
  "address": "",
  "website": "",
  "contact_form_url": "",
  "services": [],
  "support_notes": ""
}

    Combine them into a JSON array‚Äîno extra text before or after.

    Immediately beneath the JSON, list your web citations in plain text.

    Use web browsing to verify phone numbers and contact‚Äë/quote‚Äëform URLs and to ensure they actually cut tabletops (not just windows).

    Prefer companies within 30 miles of downtown {CITY}; if you must include one farther away, note the distance in support_notes.

    Be concise‚Äîlimit support_notes to one sentence.

    If you can‚Äôt find at least five valid entries, say ‚ÄúFEWER THAN 5 RESULTS‚Äù instead of the JSON.‚Äù
