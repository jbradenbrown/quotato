    Please return a json which contains a "type".
    If the reply is a quote, it must include a "quote amount", which should be a float.
    If the reply is a needs_info, it must include "questions", a list of questions ([str]).
    If the reply is a decline, it must include "reason", a reason given for being declined, if no reason is given, state so.
    The message body should be in a "contents".
